Therefore, can you please not trade the next few invoices on Freshways that cover this value of 8,778.20 and confirm the invoices numbers? I will keep a note of them in the Originators folder and once these are paid, the payment will be used to clear invoices 21265, 21595 & 21777.

            "ticket_description": "CC this to everyone in the company before returning to me, please.It is clear that many people in the company do not understand how the relationship between an Organisation, a Contact an Opportunity and Related To actually works.  To use the CRM correctly so that RPAs can be issued with the correct Contact and Organisation details, it is very important that you fully understand this ticket.  Use this ticket and fully familiarise yourself with these instructions.A simple explanation of the key relationship is that an Opportunity is specific to a Contact (and the CRM doesn't care who that Contact works for or who that Contact is Related to).  So an Opportunity can be Related To a partner, advisor, Agent, lead referrer or Intermediary (collectively 'Related To Company'), because this is the Related To Company that gave you the initial lead, but the same Opportunity is for a specific Contact and that Contact works for a specific Organisation (which is NOT the Related To Company). A good example of how these four items relate to each other is in the case of Celtic Invoice Discounting a.k.a. Celtic ID.  Once you find the Organisation Celtic Invoice Discounting a.k.a. Celtic ID, click the Contacts link on the right side of the screen and you will see three people's names and these are three people that work for Celtic ID.  Still remaining in the Organisation Celtic ID, now click the Opportunities link on the right side of the screen and there will ten or more of them.  All of the Opportunities are Related To Organisation Celtic ID.  Open any one of these Opportunities by clicking on the Opportunity Name, e.g. 20160314001 - Firehalt.  Now you will notice that if you click on the Contacts link on the right side of the screen, you will probably only see one person's name and this Contact is the person that will be receiving your RPA (i.e. and is not anyone that works for Celtic ID).  Click on the First Name or Last Name of this Contact and you will see that this Contact is connected to an Organisation (that is not Celtic ID).  In the 20160314001 - Firehalt example, Robert Pashley is connected to Organisation Name Firehalt Limited.  It is the details in the Firehalt Limited Organisation record that will be used for any RPA Offer that the CRM system issues.  It is also Robert Pashley Contact record that will receive any RPA Offer that the CRM system issues.Still remaining in the Robert Pashley Contact record, click on the name (Firehalt Limited) that appears under the Contact record heading at the top of the screen (i.e. Robert Pashley).  You are now in the Firehalt Limited Organisation record.  Use the Show Full Details button and under the Address Details heading you will see Invoice Address, Invoice P.O. Box, Invoice City, Invoice County, Invoice Postcode and Invoice Country.  As stated, it is the details in the Firehalt Limited Organisation record that will be used for any RPA Offer that the CRM system issues.Still remaining in this specific Organisation record click the Opportunities link on the right side of the screen and you will see there are no Opportunities for this Organisation.  As stated in paragraph two above, this is because the Opportunity is specific to a Contact (and not an Organisation).At this point having used this ticket and fully familiarised yourself with the instructions above, you must go back to any record that is Related To a partner, advisor, Agent, lead referrer or Intermediary (collectively 'Related To Company') and correctly connect the Opportunity to the Contact and the Organisation and at the same time use Related To to connect it to these Related To Companies.To correct any Opportunity, use the Edit button at the top of the screen and you will see the full details of the Opportunity.  Change the Related To bby clicking the magnifying glass icon and searching for the Related To Company.  If the Organisation doesn't exist, you'll need to create it and then return to the Opportunity record and then fix the relationship.If you have a Contact incorrectly linked to an Organisation, or is not linked to any Organisation, use the Edit button at the top of the screen and you will see the full details of the Contact. Change the Organisation Name by clicking the magnifying glass icon and searching for the Organisation name. If the Organisation doesn't exist, you'll need to create it and then return to the Contact record and then search again"

An employer shall ensure that? (a) places of work receive, as far as possible, sufficient natural light and are equipped with artificial lighting adequate for the protection of the safety and health of the employer's employees.  Whilst the provision of natural lighting takes precedence over artificial lighting, in practice both will be required. Artificial lighting should be adequate and properly maintained for the safety and health of persons at work.  To maximise the use of natural lighting, windows, skylights and glass partitions used for lighting workrooms should be kept clean on both inner and outer surfaces.The lighting levels should be sufficient to enable persons to detect obvious hazardsas well as being able to work without experiencing eyestrain. Lighting arrangements should be made so that brightness, unsuitable shading or poorly placed light sources or workstations cannot cause discomfort or injury from glare or from reflection of light into the eyes of the employees.Determining what is good and correct lighting depends on the visual demands of the task to be performed and the nature of the work to be performed, i.e. office work, hospital work, inspection of minute work (jewellery and watch-making), fine bench and machine work, rough bench work etc. Standards set by recognised professional bodies, such as CIBSE, should be referred to as regards determining the correct level of lightingPlease ensure this occurs today and for thos of you unfamiliar with the updated document, please ensure you read this next week and certainly before Y/E"

This conversation lasted more than 30 minutes. Stephen answered the phone before he transferred the call to me. The complaints were as follows:1)This originator emailed Treasury this morning, regarding thier Reserves Due, and looking for a payment that was in transit.\"we are concerned that there has been funds  lodged to yourselves by our customers which has not been received into our bank account yet and this does not seem to be practical.\" As Sharon and Stephen are aware there is ongoing issues with Barclays, the 404 has not been updating before 11:00/11:30 for that days transactions. It is then too late for Flatword to provide us with the Spreadsheets and for us to post these payments to account in advance of trading, so we have been a day late with posting payments. At the time of this call the above debtor payment had yet to reach us meaning it was not posted to account.This originators Reserves Due of EUR 1,484.75 are being witheld as there is overdues on the account of EUR 40,280.04.2) The originator was not informed upon sale of a number of critical issues. Peter was not aware that the discount fee would apply from the date of the invoice, as opposed to the date when he traded invoices on the account. Peter has called this fraud and illegal, and has vowed that he will only pay the discount fee from the trade date.3) The debtor statements are currently incorrect. There is an issue with the statements in terms of Purchase Payment Price. I will link this ticket to the critical ticket I have raised for Support. The invoices traded on the account are showing as traded at 80%, although the Purchase Payment figure is working out at 70%.4) Peter was informed he would not have to pay the Arrangement Fee's due to the refer a friend scheme. The only reference I see from this originators opportunity to this is from Conor's comments in this originators opportunity\"Conor Vallely2 months ago2016-05-05: Peter: Went through offer, confirmed while on the phone.Very cautious, very concerned about the arrangement fee (already referred a friend - Cyclok) and fast trade gets him to 250 which we won't fall out over.EUR375 monthly expensive.2016-04-22: Make offer\"Cyclok Limited never made it to the Sales Stage RPA Issued.Peter summarises the overall experience with Credebt Exchange as \"robbed through fraud\". The initial complaint of the discount fee applying from the invoice date as opposed to the trade date escaleted when the debtor statements were shown to be incorrect. Peter wants Patrick and/or Conor to meet him for a face to face meeting regarding his experience with Credebt Exchange. Hopefully someone can give him a ring as soon as possible. Peter also made threats to spread the word across the SME market about how terrible his experience was."

Also the fact that it is being held against regular customers invoices that the system is showing to be overdue, but in fact are within the customers payment terms. I acknowledge that we are somewhat accountable for the cause of this issue, but it has only been explained to me this morning on the telephone that I can adjust the expected payment date when uploading the invoices onto your system. Going forward we will adjust the expected payment dates to suit each customer, but in the meantime can you review the overdue invoices and the reserved funds to try and release some if not all the reserved funds.Another issue that could have very serious consequences for us and the long term use of this facility is customers complaining about being contacted about account balances and what is outstanding, in the last week alone I have been contacted by 3 customers complaining about being phoned and emailed by CE wanting balances and payment dates confirmed. And 1 has even said they may review whether they continue to pay us via this arrangement if this problem continues to persist! We are not happy that our customers are being subject to this and if they are not willing to pay us via CE then we will have to look for an alternative option!I would appreciate a response regarding both issued raised and what CE expects to do to rectify these issues going forward.Best regardsColm SprattColm SprattC & G Spratt Ltd T/A Spratt International Mobile: +353 (0)86 8713319 (Colm)             +353 (0)86 8526918 (Greg) Telephone/Fax: +353 (0)1 8414625Email: sprattinternational@gmail.com"

Screengrab attached.The creditor followed up with their bank who confirmed they have not received payment.I subsequently sent Barclays an email regarding this. Barclays have confirmed that this payment was not processed. I do not see this payment leaving our 406 account which caused confusion as I had the screengrab of the payment.From looking at the sceengrab I now see the error, the beneficiary account number entered was incorrect. This was my fault for not correctly cheching the bank details when uploading the spool file. It is strange however becuase this was the second payment we made to this creditor, with the first processed correctly. The first had the correct bank details, as per attached.To rectify this I can re-run the payment Monday, and ask Przemek how best to fix the dates in the back office to show the payment will only be made Monday.Please advise"

I've checked our call history between you and I for that date. Please find this here I:\\Recordings. And listen from 1:43. The conversation you and I had was that CTFS are going to go between 1.5% and 2% and that ''we're not going to lose any sleep over 0.5%. But if they go over 2%, a ticket needs to be raised.''I told Deidre our current intermediaries are quoted 1.5% and that they were the only ones on 2%. But she insisted that you and her agreed on 2%. 2. If you open ticket TT1399, there are 2 other intermediaries (Carty Cullen & Talk Financial, Carty Cullen only 1 investment worth 100,000 and Talk Financial only 1 investment for 20,000 EUR) who have done business with us as a result of the presentation that Paul & Deirdre held back in January 2015. Deidre mentioned she has not yet been paid for this. 3. Deirdre also mentioned commission payment on the renewal amounts for Q1, rather than on the principle amount. She said that you and her agreed that this would be paid just for Q1 as it would take too much time to calculate it for the previous years. I'm a little bit concerned over how we should approach this as I am responsible for keeping them happy."

I explain our Policy with regards to this, but he wasn't happy. I told him the only reason his overdues were so high because  he traded an Invoice (Covidien Inv 16110)  for 60days and should have traded it for a longer period, thus resulting in an overdue amount of EUR30,830. He said that this was never explained to him at the start and wants to complaint to someone in the Treasury Dept and get the EDSO days increased on this trade."

ThanksRoss Gillanders 2017-03-08 09.25 Hi there,There does not appear to be any old cenpac payments outstanding?.only recent invoices that have not yet been paid therefore we cannot allocate them off the account as it will lead to confusion when payment actually made in the coming weeks??The reason I asked for them to be allocated to credit notes is that as I have been lead to believe, each time we issue a credit note it is taken from our reserve???  My point was to add the over payments to the reserve to help reduce the negative impact of the credit notes and therefore provide us with more reserve??.We are expecting a payment from Diplomatic Missions this week so that should free up some reserve for us.  We are currently only receiving 70% of our cenpac payment and 80% of other payments traded with yourselves?..we have only received 1 payment from reserve since we began with Credit exchange last year??.This is a very disturbing fact as it essentially means the cost of working with credit exchange is on average 30% of our biggest customer base and 20% of our other accounts??..plus your fees??.Once again, I must ask for some one to reply to me with the reasoning for this and a complete break down of all costs we have been charged to date?.I have been asked by the financial director to provide this information by lunch time today.  He also requested a complete explanation of how the reserve account works and how we can get returns from this because we are essentially trading with an average of 75% of our invoice value??Thanking youRoss"

You told me that you took a decision to go with LTD, we do not HAVE to have completed all the necessary filings prior to the audit being signed off, we can reference that it is in progress. You mentioned that this point was discussed with Arthur Cox in December 2015, has Arthur Cox been responsible for making filings to Companies Register Office on behalf of Credebt Exchange? If you can make the relevant introduction for me I can ascertain where we have got to as regards the filings in order that appropriate comments can be made in the Directors Report. Thank you. MaryFollowing the commencement of the Companies Act 2014 on 1 June this year, the Companies Registration Office (CRO) has been accepting filings of new company constitutions for the purposes of converting existing private companies limited by shares to the new model private company limited by shares (LTD) or a designated activity company (DAC). The CRO has indicated that, when filing a new constitution to convert a company into a LTD or a DAC, a copy of the original signed subscriber page from the existing memorandum of association of the company must be attached to the back page of the new constitution. In addition, when filing a new constitution converting a company into a DAC, the only amendments that can be made to the existing memorandum and articles of association of the company are an update of the citation at the top of the first page of both the memorandum and articles of association to the Companies Act 2014 (in place of Companies Acts 1963-2013) and a change to the company name to include the words Designated Activity Company' or the Irish language equivalent.If a company wishes to make any additional changes to its constitutional documents on converting to a DAC, it will be necessary to file the updated constitution separately with a Form G1 after the CRO has completed the conversion of the company to a DAC.It should be noted that a company does not convert into a LTD or a DAC until the constitution has actually been registered by the CRO."

John's comments were made given the control environment at Credebt Exchange - I expect that Deloitte have assessed the overall control environment as being that of moderate to low given the fact that Credebt Exchange is an owner managed business. In my experience, owner managed businesses would be considered to be high risk from an audit perspective, this is because the owner typically has the ability to override controls that are in place. By controls examples include: Segregation of Duties; Approval Process and Authorisation Procedures. Our response to this is that you have already recognised this and are seeking to improve the governance of the organisation and control environment through strengthening the skill base in the team, at the executive level and within the different functions within the business.Mary"

Separately we have set up a Ticket for Sharon who will respond to your email received 2016-07-12 at 11:09, Sharon will be in touch with you directly.Yours  Sincerely,TreasuryHi Patrick/Sharon,Can we please arrange a conference call today as we need to clarify exactly where we stand in relation to the trading to date and your online system isn't providing this clarity for me. Please Let me know a time that suits.Br,Owen.Hi Sharon,This is not good enough and really does put our relationship into question, funds cannot be simply diverted to suit your needs irrespective of the reasons we need to be informed before any actions are undertaken. I clearly laid out our requirements and the basis of our company trading schedules to Patrick in our discussions, if Credebt cannot facilitate our requirements I will need to revaluate. This cannot be underestimated in terms of our continuing relationship, please call me to discuss further as to how we're to resolve this issue as our cashflow is presently being significantly decreased due to your actions.Regards,Owen Mc Carthy Financial ControllerHi there, In advance of Trading we received turnover projections from Lucas Luxury Packaging & therefore we had anticipated that your d-ETR would have been closer aligned to your c-ETR requirement.  We now understand that due to unforeseen circumstances in a change in the requirements of your customers and shipping delays in Rotterdam this was not achieved.  In order for us to continue to facilitate discharging your c-ETR Requirement we rerouted the Payment Purchase Price of 80% of some Trades to the Exchange. Please log on to the portal & access All Transactions, there you will see a list of deposit payments totalling EUR 220,000, funds rerouted totalling EUR 161,8374.56 and one Debtor receipt totalling EUR 33,433.17.Yours  Sincerely,Treasury"

If they re-engage, we will re-issue the RPA and re-start the process.The thinking is that if someone can't complete the application process (stress regardless of circumstance... my wife is ill, I'm in hospital, my accountant is away, the dog ate my homework, etc) in this time then the Trade Desk/Treasury have already done their best and the issue is clearly with the Originator.

            "ticket_description": "Part 1 of 2: Comment too longGood evening Patrick, It is with the greatest disappointment I find myself emailing you this evening. Over the past 12 years we have operated a very profitable business through retail and trade work in the motor industry, in essence we operate a car valeting service in both the retail sector and trade sector for some of the largest Motor Dealers in the Industry such as The Joe Duffy Group and Windsor Group to mention a few. In the past 3 years our trade work has grown exponentially and has inadvertently placed considerable pressure on our retail business, this being the source of cash flow, and given that all trade partners require 30 days credit end of month. We approached our Bank who suggested an overdraft which we refused as we are not fans of borrowing for the sake of borrowing.  They also suggested invoice discounting.I discussed this in a meeting with Mike Carty who informed me that other members of EO were also using your company. Prior to making contact with your company and during negotiations with your company we were also negotiating with Grenke and Celtic. The key issue?s were as follows: Both Grenka and Celtic required a welcome letter sent to our debtors introducing themselves to our debtors.  This is when Conor Vallely entered the fray.  Conor and I had already had a heated discussion around this and how he lied his way into pole position, I realise accusing someone of lying is a serious accusation, however, as you read on I will explain each lie which has brought me to were we are now. (1). I explained to Conor in great detail why we were uncomfortable about a cold email / letter being sent to any and all of our debtors, Conor instantly put my mind at rest stating that all we would have to do is call into the accounts department of any of our debtors and ask them to change the account to which they pay into. CV Response: (1). Larry had mentioned he was speaking with Grenke, never mentioned Celtic. Stated that Grenke insisted they send a welcome letter, I stated we require you send an email to the accounts person in your debtor company, asking them to update the payee details to reflect a central clearing account in Barclays. Larry asked what name was on the account and I told him Credebt Exchange Limited. (2). This evening Conor denied this and went on to say ?I said you?d have to send an email? I went onto say, sending an email is a long way from introducing Credebt and pointing out that the bank account was now an irrevocable destination for all payments until Credebt inform our debtors of a change.Conor apologised for this ?over-sight?.  Conor stated this evening that he believed that this was not an issue as I would have seen the letter myself eventually (after he had muscled Grenka and Celtic out of his way) CV Response: (2) 'This evening' is in relation to a 36 minute phonecall which I made to Larry starting 18:24 2017-03-02 - Larry called me a liar, said that at the outset I told him 'all he had to do was go to the office of the accounts person and stand over their desk and ask them to change the account details' - I also never 'apologised for this ?over-sight?' I told Larry he would be sent a template of this email, that he can tailor to his satisfaction, with in reason, and send it on his own letter head to the accounts person. Notwithstanding that we realised that our customers would have to change our EFT details we took this, what we now know to be a lie on the chin and accepted that the brief meeting with the accounts department of our debtors was now going to be an email / letter. This issue was overcome yesterday by both Cathal (Co director) and I travelling to all our debtors and painstakingly explaining why we were doing this and who Credebt are.During our meetings with our debtors we were asked a number of questions; the most poignant of these questions being ?are we going to be continually hassled by this crowd? Again going back to the ?muscling your way to the top? I relayed Conor's reassurance to our debtors, i.e., (3) ?Larry we have no interest in contacting your customer?s\".  Conor also went onto say, (4) \"we?re not a debt collection agency, (5) we can contact your customers if you want us to collect debts for you, that?s charged at ?140 per hour?Secure in the knowledge that our customers were not going to be contacted we presented 'Credebt' to our customers. CV Response: (3) I did say 'We don't seek to interrupt the relationship between you and your customers' CV Response: (4) I did say 'in terms of ledger administration, the raising and collecting of invoices, all remains in house' CV Response: (5) This is taken out of context and pertains to our first call - Larry had said that he received a term sheet from Grenke and the Ts&Cs were lengthy and over the top - I said that they and we do have to cover ourselves, that we also have a lengthy T&C and mentioned that their is a term which was raised to me not long ago that if CE have to provide credit control services they are charge at a rate of c.EUR 140 per hour, where I finished 'it's in there but to my knowledge has never been enforced.Part 2 of 2:Having got 3 of our debtors to email us back conformation that the EFT details were now changed, I went about uploading our first invoice, this was stopped in it's tracks surrounding another lie. (6) ?You don't need POD? CV Response (6) Larry called me and said the system was not letting him upload invoices without POD - I told Larry I would speak to support - I had no idea what a POD was (7) In the negotiating stage with Conor I again explained in great detail why we could not supply a POD and in-fact to refresh Conor's memory I sent him a remittance from a debtor today, the issue here is as follows: CV Response (7) He mentioned this yesterday evening - This was never discussed. Again, I didn't know what a POD was. When a car is traded into a dealership the salesman involved takes ?ownership? of that car, the net price of the car is only established when the final prep bill is produced, that being service, bodywork, tyres and finally valeting, in essence our invoice may have 30 cars on it which will require anything up to 10 sales people to sign off, given that they may be responsible for 1,2,3 or all carsWhen the invoice is sent into a dealership accounts department, the accounts people send the invoice to the showroom for all salespeople to sign off on their individual cars, its only at this point will a dealership confirm the invoice is authorised, hence we could never get POD or an invoice signed off by any one individual person or an accounts department. (8) Here is where the 2nd lie took flight. The POD area within the invoice upload section is a mandatory field.  I called Conor who told me he would have a member of customer support call me back, on this call I was told to ?fool? the system and enter in the invoice number in the POD area and the invoice itself in then uploaded to the POD area (interesting that you can fool parts of the system but not other parts?) (8) I wasn't on this call - x The straw that finally broke the camel's back was when we got our first invoice uploaded having ?fooled? the system, during the uploading.  Stephen who was assisting me with our first upload mentioned the next step will be contacting our debtor to confirm / authorise the invoice and so the final lie was born!I requested to be reconnected to Conor.  (9) I spoke with Conor, sensing he was uncomfortable he then suggested he would call me right back on his mobile.  In hindsight I now know why, mobile calls aren't recorded, in fact any time a lie was underway it would inevitably be conducted on Conor's mobile. CV Response (9) When he told me he would not allow CE send an email to debtor asking to verify receipt of invoice - I spoke with TD team and we agreed we wouldn't send said email until I spoke with Sharon - I spoke with Sharon, asked if we could allow Larry send an email worded 'Please confirm invoice received and all in order' I did then call Larry back on my mobile, to avoid Ross hearing about this part of the account approval process, in private, and asked Larry to send this email - Larry told me Damien (debtor) would tell him to 'F&*^ Off' and went on to explain why this couldn't be done - '6 people have to sign off on invoice with signatures etc before invoice can be verified' -  I attached this to the system, and wrote the following 'Looks to me like standard RAV won?t be possible so either a workaround or we don?t trade Crystal Valet' (10) The follow on from this call was that Conor suggested he would call me back in 4 hours (odd I thought). In the meantime to my amazement, Barry called Western Motors to confirm / authorise the 1 and only uploaded invoice, this having been discussed and a personal guarantee given by Conor that this would not happen, resulted in Western Motors refusing to further engage Credebt. (10) I told Larry to hold off on doing anything on the system as I needed to speak to Treasury to find a solution. I knew this would take some time and 4 hours was COB. Phonecall was made to Western Motors in the meantime and I did not request this or have any knowledge of it until I received Larry's email telling me so. The sad and sorry issue now is we have instructed only yesterday longstanding, loyal and multi million euro customers to pay us into a Barclays account only to have to change this again.  This unprofessional embarrassing saga will have little effect on Credebt but will and has already done untold damage to our longstanding professional relationship with Western Motors. Today Joe Duffy Group called our offices 3 times to confirm the Barclays account as is their methodology for setting up a new EFT is to record the supplier agreeing to the IBAN and swift code, they are calling again at 10am tomorrow morning.Should you view this email as frivolous or not find a solution by 09:30 tomorrow the 03/03/17, I will revert our customers back to our own bank account. Crystal Valet Centre?s are 12 years dealing with our trade partners and I can honestly say that this is the most vulnerable I have ever felt as a trade supplier.Lies will always surface, I am at a loss how Conor ever thought this was going to be acceptable to us and our debtors. On a final point, I have no doubt Conor will continue to deny all of this, my question Patrick is, why would I have lead Crystal Valet to this point if not for being lied to all along.  Please remember here, Grenke and Celtic are a cheaper alternative to us,  the only difference is they were upfront from the start about debtor contact POD requirements and welcome letters. Throughly disappointed I await your response. Larry Craughwell 0879910633"

I know there is an overdue of ?982.22 but I had taken that into account.I can't understand why my sterling reserves would be put into a minus figure and euro reserves not touched at all?I've given my MD - Helen - figures this morning for Monday forecast based on what I knew we had available from the system, which is now not going to be the case.Can someone advise why this is the case? I spoke with Barry this eve and he could see what I was talking about but couldn't advise why it had happened.RegardsDenise Herbert\"I set up a ticket for Przemeck (TT2577) to ensure this doesn't happen again. \"Good Morning Denise,Thank you for the email. The back office had intended to process your Reserves Due of EUR 2,152.86 on Friday.Due to human error assuming all were EUR denominated accounts, the back office processed a reserve payment on the following:Jewson Ltd - GBP 1,116.68SIG Building Products - EUR 904.69General Hardware Limited -  EUR 131.49As per the above, a reserve payment of EUR 1,036.18 & GBP 1,116.68 was incorrectly processed for payment.The net effect of this means we have overpaid Greenspan on the GBP account, with an underpayment of a lesser amount due to FX rates on the EUR account.We apologise for the inconvenience caused. In order to rectify this, we may release the underpayment on the EUR today if required?You may wish to return the GBP reserve amount back to the exchange in order the mitigate it's negative status. Alternately Treasury is happy to wait for the Reserves Due on the GBP account to accumulate in due course.Yours Sincerely,Treasury\"Denise reply.\"Thank you for the prompt reply. Can you arrange for the euro reserves to be released straight away please & thanks.Once you are happy, we can  wait for the reserves due on the GBP to accumulate in due course.RegardsDenise Herbert\"This issue is now sorted with Denise as we agreed to pay the EUR Reserves due and wait for the GBP reserves to accumulate."

Can someone ring me regarding this ASAPRegards Denise Following this Denise rang me and explained that she was not looking for an o-ETR  simply trying to trade a d-ETR which included RCT = 20% and retention = 5%. Approval to then reduce the PP% was sought from Treasury. It was agreed that we would reduce the PP% on this debtor to 70%. please see email: From: CE Treasury [mailto:treasury@credebtexchange.com] Sent: Friday, May 26, 2017 11:21To: Denise Herbert Subject: RE: NicoleHi Denise, Thanks for this and apologies for the misunderstanding. I tried ringing you back but I was told you were in a meeting.As discussed I have obtained approval to reduce the Purchase Payment price on Winthrop to 70% which will accommodate for any losses incurred on this. Please feel free to begin trading on this debtor, I will hold the Trade Floor until you get this up.Denise then rang and argued this saying could we perhaps do 75%. At this stage Sharon had rang in and I asked her perhaps that we could change it to 75% - however given that the total RCT & retention on this trade would have been 25% Treasury did not want to give a higher PP%. I rang Denise who I told that it was either trade the invoice today at 70% or wait until Monday. I told her that we will hold the Trade floor until 13:00 for her. I did not see her Trade at 12:45. Moments later, probably 12:56 I received a call from an irate Helen demanding to speak to Sharon. I told her Sharon wasn't here and that she could trade the invoice at 70% or wait until Monday. Helen asked me to try and speak to Sharon and call her back immediately. It was already 13:05 at this stage, she had not uploaded the invoice and I needed to take the Trade Floor. While doing this Helen rang again this time it was Stephen who answered."

Firstly, The View Tag - #XXX drawer should have an Edit and a Close button on the bottom. Edit closes the View drawer and opens the Edit drawer. Edit Tag - #XXX should have the Status: Open (default when created by a User/User Group), Viewed, Completed and Returned. All Status should be updated automatically based on the user's actions, therefore there should be no ability to manuually change the Status DDD. The Viewed status is automatically updated when the user opens the View or Edit drawer. X or Cancel also changes the status to Viewed. It also changes the colour fo the tag in the chat history to grey. \nThe Edit Tag - #XXX should have a second text box Response that is not mandatory. At the bottom of the Edit Tag - #XXX there should be a Completed, Returned, Update and Cancel button. Update also changes the status to Viewed. Using the Completed button with, or without entering text in the Response text box marks the Tag as Completed. It also changes the colour of the tag in the chat history to black. \nTo use the Returned button there must be text in the Response text box (and if not the user gets a warning message: To Return this Tag, you must enter a text Response) and there is red highlighting on the Response text box field. The Returned button marks the Tag as Returned. It also changes the colour of the tag in the chat history to black. And it also creates a Comment in the chat History and adds a Tag for the User/User Group that tagged them in the first place.\nIn Edit Tag - #XXX, Deadline Date is a mandatory field. Disable this.\nIn the Tag interface, the Status will now have the filter containing Open, Viewed, Completed and Returned. Open and Viewed will automatically be checked so they appear by default when the user clicks the Tag menu item. Completed and Returned will be unchecked by default so that the user has to check the filter checkbox to see Completed and/or Returned items. Completed and Returned will also change the Holder of the Tag to the User/User Group the Tag was responded too.\nThe Tag columns should not show Master Ticket or Deadline as there are none. Instead the Tag columns should show Person.\nSubject should be renamed Tag Item and currently it is showing only the LOaDS name e.g. Springest but the two pipes and user and date should be removed, e.g. |George Keenan|2021-11-29\nCurrently the Tag Item is not showing the Ticket number e.g. TK18109 when it should and the two pipes and user and date should be removed, e.g. |Patrick Reynolds|2020-02-18\nClone should be removed from the Actions icons. Floating text should be View Tag, Edit Tag, Go to Tag, Delete and Reassign. Reassign shoudl show Users and User Groups.\nFor Reassign, in addition to the text \"Reassign to George Keenan. Are you sure you want to reassign this tag to George Keenan?' Yes/Cancel there should be a Response text box field below this and the user must enter text before the Yes button is enabled. The Yes button works the same as the Returned button above and marks the Tag as Returned, but it changes the colour of the tag in the chat history to black. It also creates a Comment in the chat History and adds a Tag for the User/User Group that tagged them in the first place."

For example, in the current Design, there is an ability to name an Opportunity but no ability to name a Lead or a Deal. This just bad design. Particularly when the initial briefing document stated that there is no difference between a Lead, an Opportunity and a Deal other than they are stages in a process.\r\nAnyhow, the harder I looked at the issue, the more it became obvious that they system's design has possibly (and I hope not) fallen into the same flaw that SF has by treating a Lead differently to an Opportunity or a Deal. Meaning that the Organisation and the Person aren't 'real' until they are 'converted'. Assuming this isn't the case and the core design is correct, then implementing a useful SOLD screen will be straightforward.\r\nThe Add SOLD drawer is the same as View and Edit in terms of layout and it should read Add SOLD and the Add SOLD.png interface requires a lot of work to make it fit for purpose. A detailed examination of this interface and every function, label, text, layout, etc is required. The Deal Maker System process is all about SOLD and is the core of the design. This needs to be fixed or the process will remain flawed.\r\nRemove the ? floating text from all fields except: SOLD Name, Organisation Name, Knowledge, SOLD Value, Person's Name, Timeline Date, SOLD Source Details, Related Person/Organisation Name(s), Deadline Date, SOLD Initial Chat, Relationships and Related Items.

This is great and should make our co-operation much easier.\n\nYou will have answered dome of these questions already but lets start afresh as agreed above and approach this as a totally new project. You may recall that one of the issues Trade Desk had was the ability to match previous voyages to payments in the bank. Lets address this thoroughly so that issue is put to rest.

You were very clear in your assurance that adding users was simple and that you could control their access from Credebt Machine so that they ONLY had access to Deal Maker System.  This is the second or third time where new users have been added, they don’t go to Deal Maker System but end up on Credebt Machine.\n\n \n\nThis is a security issue, it is confusing and it was not then and is not now acceptable.  Either you fix this on Credebt Machine and provide written instructions how I and specific other users can set up new users on Deal Maker System only, or you create a user management module/sub module for users in Deal Maker System.\n\n \n\nWhilst we wait for this and as this was urgent yesterday and is now critical, please get Sonam access to Deal Maker System and double check she has logged in before confirming this is solved.  You have her email and her phone number is in the Deal Maker System\n\n \n\nMany Thanks,"

Can that be added quickly and assuming the answer is yes, no doubt you will ask, where do you get the dates... for old Screen (there are very few of these), Structure and Schedule the answer is by checking each SOLD ID and using the chat History to figure out a best estimate of the most realistic date when these occurred. Where you have multiple Screen, Structure and Schedule for the same SOLD, e.g. Beauty Crop Screen, Alveus Capital d.o.o. Structure or Algatec Schedule choose the most recent one and delete the others. Call me with any questions or suggestions, please."

All Trades on this Creditor were reconciled with Payment 2, value EUR 2,754,290.30 before the R-Trade was deleted.\r\nAll the Trades on this account had a fixed commission and it seems that when the Reconciliation was removed, the commission reverted to variable. \r\nTK24125 outlines all Trades and the fixed commission for the Trade batches. Perhaps the easiest thing is for the commissions to be set back to how they were previously. I have compiled the below spreadsheet with Trade ID, Face Value and the Fixed Commission that needs to be reapplied to all Trades.
