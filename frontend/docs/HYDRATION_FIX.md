# Hydration Mismatch Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing hydration mismatches caused by browser extensions (like password managers) that add attributes like `fdprocessedid` to form elements after the page loads. This is a common issue with Next.js applications.

## Error Message
```
A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties. This won't be patched up.
```

## Solution

### 1. Custom Hook: `useHydration`
Created a custom hook that returns `true` only after the component has hydrated on the client side:

```typescript
// hooks/useHydration.ts
export function useHydration() {
  const [isHydrated, setIsHydrated] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsHydrated(true);
  }, []);

  return isHydrated;
}
```

### 2. ClientOnly Component
Created a reusable wrapper component that only renders its children after hydration:

```typescript
// components/ui/ClientOnly.tsx
export function ClientOnly({ children, fallback = null }: ClientOnlyProps) {
  const isHydrated = useHydration()

  if (!isHydrated) {
    return <>{fallback}</>
  }

  return <>{children}</>
}
```

### 3. Implementation in Login Page
Updated the login page to use the `ClientOnly` wrapper:

```typescript
<ClientOnly
  fallback={
    <Card className="rounded-md shadow-none border-none">
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle className="text-3xl text-center">Sign In</CardTitle>
        <CardDescription className="text-center">
          Loading...
        </CardDescription>
      </CardHeader>
    </Card>
  }
>
  {/* Form content */}
</ClientOnly>
```

## Benefits

1. **Prevents Hydration Mismatches**: The form only renders after client-side hydration is complete
2. **Better UX**: Shows a loading state during hydration
3. **Reusable**: The `ClientOnly` component can be used throughout the application
4. **Clean Code**: Removes the need for `suppressHydrationWarning` attributes

## Usage

For any component that might experience hydration mismatches:

```typescript
import { ClientOnly } from "@/components/ui/ClientOnly"

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <ClientOnly fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      {/* Your component content */}
    </ClientOnly>
  )
}
```

## Alternative Solutions

If you prefer a more targeted approach, you can use the `useHydration` hook directly:

```typescript
import { useHydration } from "@/hooks/useHydration"

function MyComponent() {
  const isHydrated = useHydration()
  
  if (!isHydrated) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>
  }
  
  return <div>Your content</div>
}
```

## Notes

- This solution is particularly useful for forms and interactive elements
- The fallback should match the visual structure of the main content to prevent layout shifts
- This approach is recommended over `suppressHydrationWarning` as it's more explicit and maintainable
